Here, I evaluated the performance of the optimized Neural Network model on the test data. In conclusion, XGBoost achieved the highest R² score of 86.24%, with minimal error rates (MAE: 0.206, RMSE: 0.279). These metrics highlight the model's superior accuracy and its ability to explain a significant proportion of variance in car prices, Linear Regression achieved an R² score of 78.17%, with error metrics (MAE: 0.265, RMSE: 0.351) reflecting moderate performance while the Neural Network model demonstrated moderate success with an R² score of 81.1% and error metrics (MAE: 0.242, RMSE: 0.326) slightly higher than XGBoost but better than Linear Regression. Its flexibility in modeling non-linear relationships highlights its potential, though its performance was constrained by architectural and computational limitations. Areas for improvement include refining hyperparameters, exploring more complex architectures, and increasing dataset size to enhance generalizability and reduce overfitting.
